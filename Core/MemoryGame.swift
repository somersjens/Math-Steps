//  The session state machine. Every rule that decides what a tap does lives
//  here, and every transition is guarded by the current state — that is what
//  makes double taps and double scoring impossible.
//
//  This type is deliberately free of SwiftUI and of timers: the view drives it
//  with explicit calls and asks it what to show. That keeps it fully testable.
//
//  The reef scene uses the same state machine: it opens a round straight
//  through `turnCardsOver` and `beginAnswering` — there is nothing to memorise
//  under water — and then hands over whichever answer bubble the fish touched.
