//  ClawPuzzle.swift
//  Nuts & Numbers
//
//  Builds one claw-machine level: the full sum list and a physical pile that
//  is guaranteed to stay solvable and finish empty.
//
//  The brick mound is built first and every sum is printed onto a nut before
//  play starts. Those printed numbers never move. The next sum is chosen from
//  the remaining questions whose answer is already grabable on the pile, so a
//  buried 49 simply waits until 7×7 is asked — 7×6 is asked instead while 42
//  sits on top. With no decoys the peak is always a remaining answer, so a
//  playable sum is always available.
